<h1>TheGoodNEvil's Flex Conatiner With Resizing Divs</h1>

<div class="flex-container">

  <div><p>I'm TheGoodNEvil. I'm a mexican-american weeb developer who's birthday's on October 17th. This year, I will turn 29 years old. That would be something great to accomplish, and I would also like to learn more coding languages before the end of the year. The coding languages I learn will qialify for some web develoment jobs in Silicon Valley. Silicon Valley's great, and I think working for a company or corporation there will be a great benefit. I will grow as a person, I will grow into a leader, and I will grow into an influencer.</p></div>
