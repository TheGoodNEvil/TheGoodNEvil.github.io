<h1>TheGoodNEvil's Flex Conatiner With Resizing Divs</h1>

<div class="flex-container">

  <div><p>I'm TheGoodNEvil. I'm a mexican-american web developer who's birthday's on October 17th. This year, I'll turn 29 years old. That would be 
    something great to accomplish, and I would also like to learn more coding languages before the end of the year. The coding languages I learn will 
    qualify me for jobs as a remote web developer, app developer, and software developer in my WBAMN company. I will grow as a person, leader, and 
    grow into an everlasting influencer.</p></div>
  
  <div><p>For my birthday, I wanna take my older brother skydiving and have everything recorded before I post photos and videos in my social media
    profiles. I will ask him to join me, and I'd like for him to really think about it as I am before coming to the conclusion that it will be
    an event that will forver be talked about.</p></div>
  
  <div><p>There's various coding languages I must learn before being able to help former and current student-athletes flourish in the tech industry
    as remote employees in my company. I'll make sure student-athletes joing my company will a thourough understanding that they will be learning coding
    to promote their story as early as possible, so they can get funded.</p></div>
