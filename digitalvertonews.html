<p style="text-align:center;"><i>The news article "China's Surveillance State Sucks Up Data. U.S. Tech Is Key To Storing It." was published in The New York Times website, and 
it's reported that the Chinese government utilizes U.S. technology chips in their supercomupter that uses image and video surveillance in Muslim minority group territory to 
track down Muslims that don't have a cell phone or carry 2 cell phones.</i></p>
  
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>The news article "Chemists prepare for Apple's new computers" was published in the Chemical and Engineering website, and it's reported that
Apple computers have old instructions that the new Apple M1 processing chips aren't able to execute efficiently, so computational chemists and computer scientists are 
working to fix bugs and prevent crashes to enable old software and programs to run effectively.</i></p>
  
<p style="text-align:center;"><i>The news article "Cyber Monday tips from a cyber security guru" was published in the Standard Examiner website, and it's reported that the 
period between Thanksgiving and Christmas is when consumers use their credit cards or debit cards at online stores or physical stores the most throughout the year. That's
when stores make at least 20% of their money, and it's also a time when a lot of credit card and debit card information is breached and stolen. The author suggests to
only enter your real information in online stores that are well known, and if you want to support a small business, then make sure you use a credit card instead of a debit
card. Also make sure that you pay with a card that has a chip, and don't swipe your card at small business stores.</i></p>
