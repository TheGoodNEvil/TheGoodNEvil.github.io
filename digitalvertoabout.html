<p><i>My real name's Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised in Salinas, California. I was 6 years old when I began playing soccer with a local soccer club here in Salinas 
called Deportivo Salinas and coached by Gerry Barrera. The team consisted of Latino and White players from various cities in Monterey County. At first, we played in the Washington 
soccer league where games occured every Saturday at the Washington Middle School in Salinas. My coach then created the Gavilan Youth Soccer League that hosted matches at the 
Constitution Sports Complex every Sunday. At that age, I played in all the positions. When I played on the field, I would score at least one goal per game. That same team also 
turned into a travelling team, and we used to compete in the 6v6 tournament at Sonoma State University every summer where the temperature and grass was perfect. I played forward 
and lead my team in those tournaments. The opponents were competitive teams, so it was a lot of fun. We failed to win a single trophy though. In the Gavilan Youth 
Soccer League in Salinas, we won a couple of championships against Salinas teams that consisted of Latino players with low-income families. With Deportivo, I also played in the 
NorCal Premiere League where the teams were comprised of mostly white, talented, and wealthier players where I managed to score some hat-tricks and lead my team to a 
championship in the silver division, but we weren't competent enough to earn frist place medals or first place trophies in the National Cup tournaments that we attended here in
northern and southern California. With Deportivo, I travelled to Buenos Aires, Argentina to compete against teams like San Lorenzo, River Plate, and Tigre. I tried out in 
Argentina when I was 11, a trip where my mother sponsored me, and again at 13 when I was sponsored by one of my teammate's parents. River Plate scored about 13 goals on
us on their beautiful turf field while we only scored one. I remember one of their players substituted into the friendly during the second half to score a goal from half field. I was very 
impressed by their ball control, passing, and speed of play. San Lorenzo recorded about 8 goals on us, and I believe we only attained 2 on their dirt soccer field. Depo and Tigre tied
on another of San Lorenzo's dirt soccer fields. Tigre was the poorest and less skilled of all 3 opponents, and River Plate was the richest and most talented opponent. The size and 
intelligence was easily noticable between the teams. Additionally, I competed with the Pal Leon adult soccer team in the Salinas Adult Soccer League directed by Ramon Hernandez whom I debuted with in the
adult league as a right winger and forward in the summers during my college years. I scored few goals, but the team needed greater chemistry and team players in order to win 
games. I've also played in the Monterey County adult league Deportivo Salinas for a few games where I was captain, and I was then benched without explanation. I quit the team,
and I have not communicated with those individuals any further. Additionally, I've played with teams consisting of mostly players from Michoacan, including cousins of mine. I've
been invited to play with Mission in the adult league, but I told them that I wanted to play with a team that practiced. I believe zero teams are practicing.</i></p></marquee>

<p><i>El Sausal Middle School's soccer team's the one I played for during 7th and 8th grade. I was a starter as a right winger being directed by coach Guillermo Reyes towards 
league victors. I graduated middle school and continued my student-athlete career at Alisal High School where I first played amongst older, fit, and talented players that were
unanimously known as a league's, county's, state's, and nation's super power. At Alisal, I competed in the varsity team as a right midfielder and forward all 4 years being
directed by coach Jesus Sanchez my first 2 years and Mark Cisneros my last 2 years. My behavior on the field and off the field was immaculate, and the class work, homework, and 
trainings were demanding and fun work that I completed. I was a substitute my freshmen year, and I also commenced my 2nd year as a bench player. I believe it was the 1st or 2nd
game where I entered the match as a subtitute to maintain possesion of the ball, win the ball back, and to score a goal. I outperformed the frist string right winger and became a
a starter the next game. I clinched league chamipionships every season, a Homestead Cup championship, and a Central Coast Section championship my 
senior year. We easily won the league championship all 4 years, and we qualified to the CCS playoffs all 4 years. I won a position in the all league 2nd team my 3rd year, and I 
claimed the starting position as a right winger and captain in the all-league's 1st team my 4th year. I was captain of my team during my 3rd and 4th years. I appeared in news
articles 2 times before my high-school soccer career ended.</i></p></marquee>

border-radius:5px;height:200px;"><p><i>I didn't receive any recruitment letters from any top soccer programs in the nation, but my club coach suggested I attend the University 
of San Francisco and study Exercise and Sports Science. I listened to him and decided to meet with U.S.F.'s soccer program coaches. I believed they liked me, so I was allowed 
into the team as a walk-on. An opportunity that I was very excited about. That means I wasn't recruited and given any athletic scholarships, but I was an awesome 
student-athlete. I was given academic scholarships to the university and by the US government. The university and government paid a total of approximately 75% of my tuition and 
board to the university. I was extremely happy when I recieved the offer. I had hopes of becoming a professional soccer player and playing for the San Jose Earthquakes, but I 
didn't make the starting team or the bench. Instead, I had to red-shirt my freshmen year. I thought that was ok, and I was going to be patient and wait until next season to 
play, but the coaches just recruited european players over me. I was supposed to go to a pre-season camp, but I was told by the head coach, Erik Visser, that I would not be going to the camp but
was welcomed to be in the team's photo. It could've been that they didn't believe in my potential as a soccer player, or it could've been a political reason. Other players may have
been playing the coaches to play, and there's also a possiblity that someone more important than the coaches didn't want me to succeed in their soccer program. I rejected the 
offer, and decided to not play for a year. I have strong beief that I, a domestic player, wasn't given the coaching and time to prepare me for a future in professional soccer
with an MLS team. Instead, I played intramural soccer and club soccer where I still travelled with the club team to play successful teams like UC Berkeley and 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I was a starter in both my intramural team and the club team, and there was players that wanted my position. I maintained my function in the intramural
and club teams. I won a few championships with the intramural team, but we didn't win any championship with the club team. In my junior year, I rejoined the vasrsity team at 
U.S.F. that was still managed by the same coaches. Again, I didn't play much under those coaches, and the teams that they had coached the past 3 years didn't do very well. The 
coaches resigned or got fired and a new staff of coaches was hired. The new coaches were more charismatic and optimistic. They were younger, and they enjoyed watching players 
like myself. They also had a more offensive playing style, which is what I prefer. The head coach was Eddie Soto. I played against teams like UC Berkeley and Saint Mary's. I 
played very few minutes, and I was still very unsatisfied as a player. The day came when we played against Stanford University, and unfortunately, it was on the same day as my 
mother's birthday. I missed the game, and my coaches and teammates were upset at me. That pretty much destroyed my opportunity to become a starter and play another season or 2
before dominating the conference as a right midfielder and being considered by professional teams in MLS. Again, I wasn't being offered any athletic scholarships, so I settled for a
B.A. degree instead of staying an extra semester to pass science class and acquire a B.S. degree while playing at least 1 more season. I graduated in December 2014 before 
returning home to Salinas, California to live with my mother and siblings.</i></p></marquee>

border-radius:5px;height:200px;"><p><i>While living at home again, I've worked a few general labor jobs, and they were a workout. However, I wasn't learning much, and I knew I 
didn't want to be performing those jobs for the rest of my life. I've volunteered at the Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital inside the Emergency Department and inside the after 
procedure room. Eleven months ago, I downloaded the Mimo app to begin learning coding. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the app before learning advanced skills from 
w3schools.com. I'm now a front-end web designer and programmer with my own company called WBAMN (Win By All Means Necessary). I write websites and programs for free, and 
contributions of any amount are welcomed. I'd like to become an app and software developer where I focus on creating apps and software for the sports, medicine industries, and
security industries. Contact me now via email or cell phone lsited on my "Contact" page, so we can begin planning your programs, websites, and apps for free. Please view my "Now" page
to learn more about my present. You've read this far, and that's very much appreciated. Thank you!</i></p></marquee>
