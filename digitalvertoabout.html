<p id="first" style="text-align:center;display:none;background-color:black;color:green;border:3px outset green;border-radius:5px;"><i>My real name's Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm 
born and raised in Salinas, California. I was 6 years old when I began playing soccer with a local soccer club here in Salinas called Deportivo Salinas. At first, we played in 
the Salinas city league for a couple of years before playing in the Gavilan Youth Soccer League. At that age, I played in all the positions. When I played on the field, I would 
score at least one goal per game. That same team also turned into a travelling team, and we used to play in the 6v6 tournament at Sonoma State University every summer. We 
played some very competitive teams in that tournament, so it was a lot of fun playing there. We failed to win a single trophy in that tournament. In the Gavilan Youth Soccer 
League, we won a couple of championships. With that same team, I also played in the NorCal Premiere League where we once won a championship in the silver division. There was 
the Pal Leon soccer team in the Salinas Adult Soccer League, and I began playing in that league in the summers during my college years. I scored some goals, but we weren't good 
enough to win any championships.</i></p>

<p id="sec" style="text-align:center;display:none;background-color:black;color:green;border:3px outset green;border-radius:5px;"><i>El Sausal Middle School's soccer team's the one I played for during 7th and 8th grade, and we were one of the best teams in the middle school
league. I don't remember scoring any goals, and I'm unsure about having won a championship title in middle school. I graduated middle school, and I then moved on to Alisal High
School. At Alisal, I played in the varsity team as a right midfielder and forward all 4 years, and it was a lot of hard work in which we got what we desrved every single season.
We won the league championship all 4 years, and we qualified to the CCS playoffs all 4 years. I qualified to be in the all league 2nd team my junior year, and I qualified to be
in the 1st team my senior year. We failed to win a CCS championship my first 3 years, and we finally won the CCS Division 1 championship my senior year. I was captain of my team
my junior and senior years.</i></p>

<p id="third" style="text-align:center;display:none;background-color:black;color:green;border:3px outset green;border-radius:5px;"><i>I didn't receive any recruitment letters from
any top soccer programs in the nation, but my club coach suggested I attend the University of San Francisco and study Exercise and Sports Science. I listened to him and decided 
to meet with U.S.F.'s soccer porgram coaches. I believe they liked me, so I was allowed into the team as walk-on. That means I wasn't recruited and given any athletic 
scholarships, but I was an awesome student-athlete. I was given academic scholarships to the university. The university and government paid a total of appsoximately 75% of my 
tuition and board to the university. I was extremely happy when I receved the offer. I had hopes of becoming a professional soccer player and playing for the San Jose 
Earthquakes, but I didn't make the starting team or the bench. Instead, I had to red-shirt my freshmen year. I thought that was ok, and I was going to be patient and wait until
next season to play, but the coaches just recruited over me. I was supposed to go to a pre-season camp, but I was told by the head coach that I would not be going to the camp 
but was welcomed to be in the team's photo. I rejected the offer, and decided to not play for a year. Instead, I played intramural soccer and club soccer where I still travelled
with the club team to play prestigiuos schools like UC Berkeley and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I was a starter in both my intramural team and the club team, and there was players
that wanted my position. I maintained my position in the intramural and club teams. I won a few championships with the intramural team, but we didn't win any championship with 
the club team. In my junior year, I rejoined the vasrsity team at U.S.F. that was managed by the same coaches. Again, I didn't play much under those coaches, and the teams that 
they had coached the past 3 years didn't do very well. The coaches resigned or got fired and a new staff of coaches were hired. I liked these new coaches better. They were 
younger, and they liked players like myself. They also had a more offensive playing style, which is what I prefer. I played against teams like UC Berkeley and Saint Mary's. I 
played very few minutes, and I was still very unsatisfied as a player. I decided to settle for B.A. degree instead of staying an extra semester to pass science class and acquire
a B.S. degree, and I decided to not play my last semester to solely focus on passing my courses and graduating. I graduated in December 2014 before returning home to Salinas, 
California to live with my mother and siblings.</i></p>

<p id="fourth" style="text-align:center;display:none;background-color:black;color:green;border:3px outset green;border-radius:5px;"><i>While living home again, I've worked a few 
general labor jobs, and they were a workout. However, I wasn't learning much, and I knew I didn't want to be performing those jobs for the rest of my life. Seven months ago, I 
downloaded the Mimo app to begin learning coding. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the app before learning advanced skills from w3schools.com. I'm now a front-end web
developer and programmer with my own company. I currently write websites and programs for free, and contributions of any amount are welcomed. I'd like to become an app and 
software developer as well where I'm focused on creating apps and softaware for the medicine industry. If you want a website or program, then contact me. Thanks.</i></p>
