<p><i>My real name's Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I'm born and raised in Salinas, California. I was 6 years old when I began playing soccer with a local soccer club here in Salinas 
called Deportivo Salinas coached by Gerry Barrera. The team consisted of Latino and White players from various cities in Monterey County. At first, we played in the Washington 
soccer league where games occured every Saturday at the Washington Middle School in Salinas. My coach then created the Gavilan Youth Soccer League that hosted games at the 
Constitution Sports Complex every Sunday. At that age, I played in all the positions. When I played on the field, I would score at least one goal per game. That same team also 
turned into a travelling team, and we used to play in the 6v6 tournament at Sonoma State University every summer where the temperature and grass was perfect. I played forward 
and lead my team in those tournaments. We played some very competitive teams, so it was a lot of fun playing. We failed to win a single trophy though. In the Gavilan Youth 
Soccer League in Salinas, we won a couple of championships against Salinas teams that consisted of Latino players with low-income families. With Deportivo, I also played in the 
NorCal Premiere League where the teams were comprised of mostly white, talented, and wealthier players where I managed to score some hat-tricks and lead my team to a 
championship in the silver division. With Deportivo, I also travelled to Buenos Aires, Argentina to play against teams like San Lorenzo, River Plate, and Tigre. I played in 
Argentina when I was 11, a trip where my mother sponsored me, and again at 13 when I was sponsored by one of my teammate's parents. River Plate scored about 13 goals on
us on their beautiful turf field while we only scored one. I remember a player that entered as a substitute in the second half and scored a goal from half field. I was very 
impressed by their ball control, passing, and speed of play. San Lorenzo scored about 8 goals on us, and I believe we scored 2 on their dirt soccer field. Depo and Tigre tied
on another of San Lorenzo's dirt soccer field. Tigre was the poorest and less skilled of all 3 opponents, and River Plate was the richest and most talented opponent. There
was the Pal Leon soccer team in the Salinas Adult Soccer League coached by Ramon Hernandez whom I debuted with in the adult league as a right winger and forward in the summers 
during my college years. I scored few goals, and the team needed more chemistry and team players in order to win games.</i></p></marquee>

<p><i>El Sausal Middle School's soccer team's the one I played for during 7th and 8th grade. I was a starter as a right winger being directed by coach Guillermo Reyes towards 
league victors. I graduated middle school and continued my student-athlete career at Alisal High School where I first played amongst older, fit, and talented players that were
unanimously known as a league's, county's, state's, and nation's super power. At Alisal, I played in the varsity team as a right midfielder and forward all 4 years being
directed by coach Jesus Sanchez my first 2 years and Mark Cisneros my last 2 years. My behavior on the field and off the field was immaculate, and the class work, homework, and 
practices were demanding and fun work that I completed. I clinched league chamipionships every season, a Homestead Cup championship, and a Central Coast Section championship my 
senior year. We won the league championship all 4 years, and we qualified to the CCS playoffs all 4 years. I won a position in the all league 2nd team my junior year, and I 
claimed the starting position as a right winger and captain in the all-league's first team. I was captain of my team my junior and senior years.</i></p></marquee>

border-radius:5px;height:200px;"><p><i>I didn't receive any recruitment letters from any top soccer programs in the nation, but my club coach suggested I attend the University 
of San Francisco and study Exercise and Sports Science. I listened to him and decided to meet with U.S.F.'s soccer program coaches. I believed they liked me, so I was allowed 
into the team as a walk-on. That means I wasn't recruited and given any athletic scholarships, but I was an awesome student-athlete. I was given academic scholarships to the 
university. The university and government paid a total of approximately 75% of my tuition and board to the university. I was extremely happy when I recieved the offer. I had 
hopes of becoming a professional soccer player and playing for the San Jose Earthquakes, but I didn't make the starting team or the bench. Instead, I had to red-shirt my 
freshmen year. I thought that was ok, and I was going to be patient and wait until next season to play, but the coaches just recruited over me. I was supposed to go to a 
pre-season camp, but I was told by the head coach, Erik Visser, that I would not be going to the camp but was welcomed to be in the team's photo. I rejected the offer, and 
decided to not play for a year. Instead, I played intramural soccer and club soccer where I still travelled with the club team to play successful teams like UC Berkeley and 
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. I was a starter in both my intramural team and the club team, and there was players that wanted my position. I maintained my position in the intramural
and club teams. I won a few championships with the intramural team, but we didn't win any championship with the club team. In my junior year, I rejoined the vasrsity team at 
U.S.F. that was still managed by the same coaches. Again, I didn't play much under those coaches, and the teams that they had coached the past 3 years didn't do very well. The 
coaches resigned or got fired and a new staff of coaches were hired. The new coaches were more charismatic and optimistic. They were younger, and they enjoyed watching players 
like myself. They also had a more offensive playing style, which is what I prefer. The head coach was Eddie Soto. I played against teams like UC Berkeley and Saint Mary's. I 
played very few minutes, and I was still very unsatisfied as a player. The day came when we played against Stanford University, and unfortunately, it was on the same day as my 
mother's birthday. I missed the game, and my coaches and teammates were upset at me. That pretty much destroyed my opportunity to become a starter and play another season or 2
before dominating the league as a right midfielder and being considered by professional teams in MLS. Again, I wasn't being offered any athletic scholarships, so I settled for a
B.A. degree instead of staying an extra semester to pass science class and acquire a B.S. degree while playing at least 1 more season. I graduated in December 2014 before 
returning home to Salinas, California to live with my mother and siblings.</i></p></marquee>

border-radius:5px;height:200px;"><p><i>While living at home again, I've worked a few general labor jobs, and they were a workout. However, I wasn't learning much, and I knew I 
didn't want to be performing those jobs for the rest of my life. I've volunteered at the Salinas Valley Memorial Hospital inside the Emergency Department and inside the after 
procedure room. Eleven months ago, I downloaded the Mimo app to begin learning coding. I learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through the app before learning advanced skills from 
w3schools.com. I'm now a front-end web developer and programmer with my own company called WBAMN (Win By All Means Necessary). I now write websites and programs for free, and 
contributions of any amount are welcomed. I'd like to become an app and software developer where I focus on creating apps and software for the sports and medicine industries.
Contact me now via email or cell phone lsited on my "Contact" page, so we can begin planning your programs, websites, and apps for free. I'm also a Community Health Worker for 
East Salinas Building Healthy Communities where I inform Monterey county residents about the COVID-19 resources that are accesible by them for free. Please view my "Now" page
to learn more about my present. You've read this far, and that's very much appreciated. Thank you!</i></p></marquee>
