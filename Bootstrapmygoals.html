  <h1>My Second Bootstrap Page: My Goals In The Next 6 Months</h1>
  
  <div class="row">
  
    <div class="col-sm-2">In August, I want to begin building the web page or website for my first client. There's a couple of persons that asked me 
      about making a website for them, and I told one of them that I could make a website for him for $50. He said he would contact me back, but he 
      never did. The other person wants me to build a website for his future construction company, and I told him that I was very willing to make him 
      the website. He asked me what I needed from him, and I told him to simply take a look at my web page and tell me his thoughts about it. He was 
      too busy to take a look at a single web page. I'm going to do some more advertising in all of my social media platforms, so I can get contacted 
      by more persons.</div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-2">In September, I want to be satisfied with the web developing knowledge I've aquired, and I have to be confident about 
      finsishing any website that I'm asked to create withing 2 weeks. That means that I want to complete at least 2 websites by the end of September 
      and should make at least $100. With $100, I can buy healthier food and cook for myself more often. If you follow me in Instagram, then you know 
      that I post a photo of at least one of my meals every day.</div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-2">In October, I want to be able to stream my coding sessions. Right now, I can code for a couple of hours before I get up to 
      go for a walk, and I can then come back and code for another 2 hours before I have a meal. In these streaming sessions, I'm hoping I can get 
      at least one viewer that's really intrigued by coding and would like to learn how to code. Also, I would like for at least one of my viewers to 
      be a professional coder, so he/she can give me coding tips and get to the point where we're co-streaming.</div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-2">In November, I want to be able to call myself a professional front end coder with a legit business where I'm making at 
      least $1,000/month. That means that I'll have to be a professional at using HTML, CSS, and Java Script to build the front end websites that 
      are requested by my clients within my WBAMN business. This also means that I'll have to be finishing at least 20 websites/month to make 
      $1,000/month. If you research the salary for a web developer, then you'll find out that they make at least $100,000/year. Most likely, I'll 
      be charging for the amount of time I spend making a website. I'd like to charge $10/hour. I'm sure I can clock in at least 56 hours/week.</div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-2">In December, I want to be able to afford my own studio room here in Salinas, California, my own BMW, my own food, and other 
      living expenses. If I make at least $2,000/month, then I should be able to afford everything I desire in December. I honestly plan on spending 
      my entire life here in Salinas, California, so I can stay close to my family members. If I begin to make more money, then I'm thinking my family 
      members and I can buy a new home here in Salinas, California or in another state where the cost of a home is a lot cheaper. I love hot weather, 
      so Arizona's the most likely state that I'll be moving to.</div>
    
    <div class="col-sm-2">In 2021's January, I want to already be living in my own room with my girlfriend. I want a girlfriend that I can wife up, 
      so we'll most likely get married within a year or 2. I'm attracted to beatiful, fit, and intelligent caucasian women, and I'd like them to be 
      at least 18 years old and younger than 31 years old. I'd like for her to be Mexican-American like myself,and I'd also welcome other 
      nationalities. With my girlfriend, I want to be able to have a very sexually active relationship, a very active lifestyle relationship, and a 
      very intelligence growing relationship.</div>
