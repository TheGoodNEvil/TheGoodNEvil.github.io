<h1>Mexican Colors</h1>

<p>My parents were born in Mexico. My mother was born in the Michoacan state, and my father was born in the Hidalgo state. They both travelled to the United States and met in Salinas, California while working as strawberry pickers. They got together before my mother gave birth to me.</p>

<h1>American Colors</h1>

<p>My name's Gerardo Tapia Vera, and I was born in Salinas, California at the Natividad Hospital on October 17th, 1991. I'm the first american child of both of my parents, and I'm blessed to be Mexican American.</p>
