      <h3>My Alisal High School Career</h3>
      
      <p>At Alisal High School, I played varsity soccer all of my 4 years, and I won the league championship every single year. I also became a 
      starter in the team my sophomore year, became the captain my junior year, and I led the team to a CCS title my senior year.
      I was an upstanding soccer player, so I was selected to play for the all-league first team as the starting right midfielder. I enjoyed being a
      student, so I accumilated an above 3.5 G.P.A. at the time I graduated from Alisal. I excelled as a high scholl student-athlete, and I knew 
      I wanted to play soccer at the university and then professional levels. Therefore, my club soccer coach encouraged me to meet with the coaches 
      at the University of San Francisco. I met with them, and they gave me the opporunity to try out for their team without any athletic scholarships.

      <h3>My University of San Francisco Career</h3>
      
      <p>At the University of San Francisco, I walked onto the varsity team and red-shirted my freshmen year. I loved lifting weights at 7am until 8am
        on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays and then training at 10:30am to about 12:30pm every day. At the end of my freshmen year, the head coach
        stated that everyone needed to be fit before the fall semester to guarantee their spot in the team. I passed my cooper test and my 
        beach run test, so I was one of the 10 players who were actually fit to go on the training camp before the fall season started. After the
        fitness tests and a few training sessions, every player had a meeting with the coaches. In my meeting, I only met with the head coach, and he 
        told me that I was not selected to go to the training camp. I was surprised, and he told me that if I wanted to, then I could be in the team 
        photo. I denied being in the team photo, ended the meeting, and I walked out of his office. Although I was dissapointed, I also felt a lot of 
        weight lifted off my shoulders and felt free. I then played in the club soccer team my sophomore and junior year, where I travelled throughout 
        California and had a starting position in the team. I enjoyed playing for the club team, and I was happier playing for the varsity team. 
        In my junior year's spring semester, I returned to the varsity team. I just loved playing soccer. In my senior year's spring semester, the team
        got new coaches. I liked these coaches more, and I liked my teammates too. I believed that I could become a starter in the team, but my 
        financial aid was going to be over, meaning I wasn't going to be given any more federal grants. My coach didn't offer me any athletic 
        scholarships, so instead of playing my 9th semster, I decided to not play and just focus on acquiring my bachelor's of arts degree in Exercise 
        and Sports Science.</p>

      <h3>I'm TheGoodNEvil Now</h3>
      
      <p>After graduating from the University of San Francisco, I moved to my home in Salinas, California to live with my family and work a general 
        labor job as a broccoli dumper at True Leaf Farms in San Juan Bautista, California. I worked there in 2015 from April to November and was
        getting paid $10.72/hour. It's my best job in the past 5 years. However, some shady changes occured in my home while I was working at True Leaf
        Farms, and one of the changes was that my family members seemd to have forgotten our old ways of doing things. We used to be more efficient 
        before. Three years ago, I got into an argument with my youngest sister and older brother about the placement of food in the refrigerator, and
        I was being told that it was my mother's food and had no right to be moving it. My mother had already told me that I could've had some of her 
        food, but they wouldn't agree with me. In the argument, I explained to them that I've helped my mother move her groceries ever since I was a 
        boy, so I had the right to move the groceries that were inside and outside the refrigerator. My mother wasn't asking me to pay for rent or food
        at that time, and they didn't like that. My brother stated that he would lock the refrigerator, and I told him that I would kill him. They 
        called the police on me, and I was taken to the emergency department in the nearest hospital. There, I was escorted to the mental health unit, 
        and I was misdiagnosed with anxiety, depression, and schizophrenia. I was given medicine that caused me to hallucinate and hear 
        voices. I've been taking medicine for schizophrenia for 3 years now, and I still hear voices. The voices don't bother me though, I can live 
        with them. I've been fortunate to have worked a few other jobs in the past 3 years, but I wasn't doing what I really loved. I love learning, so
        I began coding 4 months ago. I've used HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create this website, and I've now used Bootstrap to create better 
        responsive web pages for all devices. You've read this far, and it's apprecaited. Please, take a look at my other skills and layouts inside my
        other webpages. In adavnace, thanks.</p>
