            I'm a single 29 year old Mexican-American who's been single for 8 years now, and I've searched for a girlfriend online in social media and in dating applications. 
            I haven't been able to find a girlfriend, and I sometimes think that I've been cursed to not find a girlfriend or a wife. I'm more attracted to light skinned and 
            blonde females with athletic bodies. I'm searching for a girl that has a college education, enjoys exercising, and has at least a part-time job. As of me, I'm a 
            front end web designer working daily to master my creativity! I do this kind of work for free from home, and I also work for East Salinas Building 
            Healthy Communities in Monterey County as a CHW. I aspire to make a website for everyone on this planet, so they can represent themselves in the 
            digital world. At Building Healthy Communities, my current function is to educate Monterey county individuals on the COVID-19 resources that they have. At this time,
            there's 3 active programs in the county for the homeless, agriculture workers, and healthcare workers to isolate and quarantine in a hotel room. The first program's 
            called Project Roomkey, the second program's called Housing for the Harvest, and the third program's called Non-Congregate Sheltering for California Healthcare 
            Workers. Individuals isolating or quarantining need food to be delivered to their residencies, and we provide that service for them as well. Every city has a food 
            distribution day, and you should call your local food bank to find out which day and what time the food distribution is. The United Farm Workers Foundation has a 
            Salinas office that distributes food every Wednesday from 3pm-5:30pm. I've volunteered there before, and volunteers with larger families are allowed a greater
            quantity of food boxes to be taken home. East Salinas Building Healthy Communities also provides relief funds to Monterey county residents, so they can pay off 
            their utility bills, buy food, or rent bills. My days at work mostly consist of chatting with immagrants at La Princesa Merkets in East Salinas and at La Plaza Bakery
            in East Salinas as well. I've expressed that we need to move on to other outreach locations like the Northridge Mall and movie theatres. The immigrants have migrated 
            to Salinas to work in the agriculture and food industries, and a lot of them are illiterate to the point where they can't read or write their own language, Spanish. 
            Also, some residents display terrible interest in these resources, and it could be because they don't want to give out their name, contact information, and living 
            situation to strangers. The immigrant workers may also think that these resources cost money and don't want to spend the small quantity of money they earn. It takes 
            me about 5 seconds to ask these indivudals if they want to hear about our COVID 19 resources, so it's critical I say key words clearly and quickly to clinch their 
            attention. Twenty-five percent of the individuals I've approached declined to hear about the resources, 25% listen to me, and the other 50% say that they're already 
            vaccinated and aware of the resources. The 3 locations where I've done outreach at have generally increased their positive response in which it's a great pleasure to
            converse about the individual's reactions to the COVID-19 vaccines and their COVID-19 Relief Funds. A strawberry worker promised to bring me some strawberries, but he's
            yet to do so. Our efforts have surely been translating into a positive impact, and we've vaccinated residents at over twice the rate of the entire nation. It's
            an honor to be working at these outreach locations, but I still feel that I'm not doing enough. As a result, I'm thinking of changing my work attire from casual to 
            professional and risking comfort to appear more presentable. I may to wear long socks, dress shoes, dress pants, a dress shirt, a tie, and a blazer. When I'm not 
            working or volunteering, I'm usually listening to techno, corridos, and rap, reading Microsoft Learning Documents to learn more coding technologies that allow me to 
            publish websites, reading non-fiction books about the CIA, spies, and information security, or playing action video games on my Xbox One like Tekken 7, King of 
            Fighters XIII, Mortal Kombat 11, or Call of Duty Modern Warfare. If you need my services, then please visit my "Contact" page where you're enabled to send me emails
            or call my cell phone number. You've read this far, and I appreciate that very much! Thank you!
