<h1>TheGoodNEvil</h1>
<p>I'm TheGoodNEvil, and I'm from Salinas, California. I'll
be 29 years old this year on October 17th, and I'm currently single and
looking for a girlfriend. I'm a 5'6" Mexican-American with brown hair,
brown skin, brown eyes, and an average body. I like going for walks, dancing,
working out, playing soccer, and playing Modern Warfare. I'm into beautiful,
fit, and intelligent women, and I prefer caucasian and blonde women that are
at least 18 years old and younger than 30 years old. I live in Salinas, California 
with family members in a full house, and the family's growing. I've had only a 
couple of jobs that I really liked, so I decided to learn coding and start my own 
business. I'm just starting my own website development business. My company's name's 
WBAMN, and it stands for Win By All Means Necessary. I'm the only employee, and I 
work from home. I created my company to make websites, apps, and softaware for all 
persons, especially athletes, that are looking to actively promote themselves further.
If you would like to know more, then contact me in one or more of my links
listed below. Thanks.</p>
